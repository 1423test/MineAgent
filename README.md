# MineAgent: Towards Remote-Sensing Mineral Exploration with Multimodal Large Language Models

MineBench is a Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset designed for mineral deposit exploration using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The dataset comprises 612 geological areas (73 positive, 539 negative).

MineBench provides a unique challenge to MLLMs where both multi-image reasoning and long-tail domain understanding are required to accomplish one task.


## âš¡ Example of MineBench
MineBench presents real-world deposits combined with synthetic mineral patterns, as illustrated below:


It includes four images: one geological image and three hyperspectral images. The synthetic mineral patterns are evaluated based on two key criteria:
**Spatial Consistency**: Confirming that the colored regions across the three hyperspectral images exhibit smooth spatial transitions, reflecting the gradual distribution of mineral deposits.
**Geological Alignment**: Ensuring the colored regions in the hyperspectral data accurately correspond to the geological context.

To directly show the real-world deposits combined with synthetic mineral patterns, it as illustrated below:

The authentic deposit locations are marked with red points, which predominantly align with the synthetic color-coded regions.

Positive samples: These exhibit a smooth gradient of color transitions from red to yellow to orange, systematically capturing the alteration zones typical of full mineral deposits. This reflects the continuous mineralization process.

Negative samples: These exhibit distinct characteristics, such as low color intensity (indicating minimal mineralization potential) or incomplete color transitions, suggesting that the deposit is in an early or incomplete stage of formation.

## ðŸ’­ QA Pairs Construction
To enable MLLMs to directly evaluate on MineBench, the image-label pairs were converted into a Visual Question-Answering (VQA) format. The process involves the following steps:

1.**Task Definition**: Mineral exploration is framed as a binary classification problem, assessing deposit likelihood.
2.**Exploration Context**: Three instructions were manually assigned to each area to guide MLLM responses.
3.**Final Dataset**: The dataset consists of VQA pairs with multiple images, one question, and two answer options.
